## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer who enjoys working with others to solve complex problems with clean, well-tested software. I am proficient in TypeScript and React, but am always up for a new challenge.

I'm looking for the next opportunity to work with a strong team to build products that provide value to the customer.
