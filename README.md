## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience building high-quality, well-tested applications for business and consumer customers. I enjoy:
 - learning new things,
 - taking on new challenges,
 - and solving complex problems with a team.

I have plenty of experience as a Full Stack Engineer and lean more towards the front end of the stack with a proficiency in React and TypeScript. I'm looking for the next opportunity to work with a strong team where I can both apply and grow my skills while building valuable solutions for customers.
